- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I really liked working with Inheritance, and it is very helpful since I don't have to write the same lines of code over and over again. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was confusing using the exceptions, and I had trouble with some of the getters. Running the main within every class to check each one worked, was really helpful.
